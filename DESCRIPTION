Description: Easy function for text-mining the PubMed repository based on defined sets of terms.
    The relationship between fix-terms (related to your research topic) and pub-terms (terms which pivot around your research focus)
    is calculated using the pointwise mutual information algorithm (pmi). A text file is generated with the pmi-scores for each fixterm.
    Then for each collocation pairs (a fix-term + a pub-term), a text file is generated with related article titles and publishing years.
    Additional Author section will follow in the next version updates.
