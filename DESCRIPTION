Description: Easy function for text-mining the PubMed repository based on defined sets of terms.
    The relationship between fixterms (related to your research topic) and pubterms (terms which pivot around your research focus)
    is calculated using the pointwise mutual information algorithm. A text file is generated with the pmi-scores for each fixterm.
    Then for each collocation pairs (a fixterm+a pubterm), a text file is generated with related article titles and publishing years.
    Additional Author section will follow in the next version updates.
